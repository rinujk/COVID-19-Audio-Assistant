COVID-19 has drastically changed the way of human living in 2020. We have to stay cautious, careful and follow the standard operating procedures to stop the spread of the disease. There are travel restrictions for different countries. We might want to know the number of cases in different countries. Our goal is to easily help the users know the number of COVID cases in each country. Our project is designed in such a way that we can ask the bot the number of cases in a country and the bot will reply us the number of cases. To achieve this, we will extract data from a website that updates the number of cases in each country. We will use the microphone and speech recognition libraries to listen to the user. Based on the query, the bot will match the country and reply us the number of cases in the country. This method could be helpful to know the cases and even used in AI speech assistants to answer the question precisely.
